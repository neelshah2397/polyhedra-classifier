CNN for classifying polyhedral dice
This github repo provides the code and report for a polyhedral dice classifier. The dice predictor is a pretrained Densenet121 model. The data for the model can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/ucffool/dice-d4-d6-d8-d10-d12-d20-images

The final model had 98% accuracy. The report discusses our previous attempts and design decisions for the project.
